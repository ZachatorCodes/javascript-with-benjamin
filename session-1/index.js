// In JavaScript, if we ever want to see the result of our code, we are going to use
// console.log()
// Anything that we want to show up in the console we are going to put inside the ().

console.log();

// There are three types of expressions in JavaScript

// 1. Constant Expression - Expresssions that always result in the same answer
console.log(1 + 1);
console.log(49);
console.log(100 / 10);

// 2. Assignment Expression

// When we are using asssignment expression OR creating variables, we use something called camelcase
// For variables, we start with a lowercase letter, and we capitalize every other letter of a first word
const zachFavoriteFlavor = "Cookie Dough";
const benjaminFavoriteFlavor = "Cookies and cream";

// Create a variable called "my favorite color" using camel case:
const myFavoriteColor = "Blue";
const zachFavColor = "Green";

// 3. Lookup Expression
console.log(zachFavoriteFlavor);
console.log(benjaminFavoriteFlavor);
console.log(myFavoriteColor);
console.log(zachFavColor);

// VARIABLES

// In JavaScript, we have something called variable declaration.
let benjaminFavAnimal;

// We also have something called variable assignment:
benjaminFavAnimal = "Monkey";

// If we combine those steps together, we have variable initialization:
let zachFavAnimal = "Marmot";

// In JavaScript when we are creating variables, we can use let or const
// You might see "var" but we are rarely / never going to use it.
